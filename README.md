Healthcare-Website
==================

Developed a healthcare website on a Apache Tomcat web server that allowed the registration of subscribers and companies. Depending on how the user logged in, different options were displayed. Companies could add new health plans and view the subscribers of their health plans, while subscribers were allowed to view and subscribe to various health benefits provided by the companies. All accounts and health insurance options were stored in a MySQL database. This project utilized HTML, CSS, JSP & JDBC.
